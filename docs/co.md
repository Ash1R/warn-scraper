>Hi, I'm emailing on behalf of Stanford's Big Local News project.  We're trying to increase journalists' access to WARN data, and we had a question about Colorado's WARN data. 
>In comparing your 2021 data with previous years, I'm wondering if 'layoff total' in the archived data (2015-2019) represents a sum of the 'permanent layoffs', 'temporary layoffs', and 'furloughs' columns in the 2021 data. Would that be a fair assessment?

>Thanks for your help!
>(P.S: if you happen to have any data for Colorado before 2015, that would be nice to have!)
