Noticed historical data seemed more comprehensive than yearly data for 2019 (see WARN/#227). Sent an email bringing to their attention & asking which is the best source of the WARN data. 

"Thanks so much for this data. I noticed something interesting that I thought you might like to be aware of. After looking at the differences between the WARN historical file you provided and the 2019 data available on the public-facing website, I noticed some interesting discrepancies: https://www.diffchecker.com/LBUWndL9I was surprised to find that the historical data includes about 12 additional rows.I think this trend might extend to other years as well. I am wondering if you all are aware of this, and if so, whether the historical data or the data on the website would be a more accurate source for Texas' WARN information."
