Received a reply from TX from cisco.gamez@twc.texas.gov, with the following .xlsx file. 

[Warns 01-01-89-09-30-19.xlsx](https://github.com/biglocalnews/WARN/files/6994307/Warns.01-01-89-09-30-19.xlsx)

This file seems to overlap quite a bit with our website scraper, maybe the website scraper can just scrape from 2020 onwards?
