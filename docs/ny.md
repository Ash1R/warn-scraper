### Jul 6th, 2021
- 2021 data doesn't directly contain # employee affected in the html table on the website, needs to parse the corresponding pdf to obtain the # affected. 
- for data prior to 2021, each year is contained in a pdf and doesn't contain # affected, needs to reach out and ask if there is a better form of data/access company specific data.
