The following are some specific issues with this data that needs further processing and phone calls:
- year 2015-2019 data is in fiscal year, but year 2020 and 2021 data is in calendar year. This produced some number of duplicate data entries between 2019 and 2020 data page. Some of these duplicate entries have minor differences in number affected. This issue requires us to inquiry about the difference between the 2020 and 2019 data page as well as how updated date works for different companies (some companies have multiple entries with same date but different numbers). Currently, I am waiting for a response from the state agency.
- year 2017, 2016, 2015, has different date string format from the rest
- 2021 has a new industry column
